# Mobile Mapper!

This is a simple jQuery Mobile + PhoneGap

## Installing

If you want to use the photo uploading functionality you will need [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/)

Otherwise this app is all HTML+JS. You can open index.html in a browser to see the map interface

To install PhoneGap and mobile-mapper:

1. [Download](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios) and install XCode with iOS (this takes a while... sorry)
2. Build and install the latest PhoneGap - Instructions [here](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone)
3. Make a new PhoneGap project in XCode and put the files in this repository into the `www` folder in that Project
4. Hit "Build and Run" in XCode to launch the app
